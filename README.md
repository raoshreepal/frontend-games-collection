Got it — I’ll rewrite the README entirely in **clear English** so it’s GitHub-friendly and professional.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Download or clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/raoshreepal/frontend-games-collection.git
````

2. Open the project folder.
3. Open **index.html** in your browser.
4. Click on any game and enjoy! 😄

---

## 📌 Note

If you load games from a **local JSON file**, the browser may block it due to CORS restrictions.
To fix this:

* Store the game data directly in `main.js` as an array, OR
* Run a local server (e.g., using the VS Code Live Server extension).

If you want, I can also  
- create a **homepage screenshot** (`homepage.png`) for your README,  
- and add **two more game screenshots** for a complete look.  

Do you want me to make those images now so the README looks perfect?
